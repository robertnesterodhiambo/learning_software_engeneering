# Chapter 3. Implementing Functions

In this chapter, we will move beyond the fundamentals of Dart and
introduce functions. As you may have noticed, we have already used a
number of functions (e.g., main and print). In this chapter we will explore
the main use cases for using functions.
Building more complex applications will certainly require developers to
progress beyond simple constructs. At a minimum, an awareness of some
essential concepts and algorithms is desirable. Over the course of this
chapter you will learn the foundations of code isolation.
The main use case for functions is to group instructions. The chapter begins
by illustrating how to define a basic function without parameters or a return
value. In most situations, this is not the pattern you will want to use.
However, for learning purposes it has been included. Beyond this you will
be introduced to parameters and return values. At this point, hopefully it
will become clearer why adding parameters and return values is so powerful
and the desired pattern to follow.
Toward the end of the chapter you will see examples of other ways to use
functions. Youâ€™ll discover that, as your skills grow as a developer, so will
your use of functions.
