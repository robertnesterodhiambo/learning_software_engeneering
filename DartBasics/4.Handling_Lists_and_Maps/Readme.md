# About this chapter

In this chapter, the fundamentals of data handling with Dart are outlined. 
The aim of this chapter is to cover Lists and Maps that are used to provide
foundational data structures for information handling in Dart.
If you are lucky enough to be familiar with other languages, then many of
the concepts presented should be familiar. However, in case this is your first
time seeing these techniques, the example pieces of code are self-contained.
You may find it helpful to run and experiment with the examples to gain a
feel of the workings of the language.
The chapter begins by discussing Lists, which are indexable data structures
used to hold objects. Lists are very common elements in Dart, as they can
be used in a variety of scenarios.
We also discuss how to use Maps, which are useful for handling key/value
pairs. A key/value pair is an associative relationship where the key is used
as an index to access a value. For example, you may have a months of the
year data structure in which the key is a number and the value is derived
from the number, e.g., 1 generates the month January and 12 denotes
December.
Over the course of this chapter, you will learn how to utilize Maps and Lists
within your application.
