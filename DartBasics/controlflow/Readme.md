# Control flow 
this is how  instructions are executed
## verifying condition is met

   -if statements 
   ```dart
   void main (){
     bool football = true;
     if(football){
     print("go football);
     } else {
     print("go sports");
     }
     }
 
 ## Iteration until comtion is met
 
 here we run until a condtion is satisfied
 
    - while loop
    ```dart
    void main(){
    bool istime =true;
    while (istime){
    print("Lets eat");
    istime = false;
    }
